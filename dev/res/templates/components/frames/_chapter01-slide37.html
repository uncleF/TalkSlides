<div class="frame frame-is-dark">
  <article class="frameContent">
    <p><u>AMP as PWA — AMP + Service Worker</u></p>
    <p>When user opens a link he is served an AMP version of the article and a Service Worker.</p>
    <p>Service Worker loads and caches content from the AMP server, while user is reading the article.</p>
    <p>After caching has completed, user is served (instantly) content from the cache.</p>
    <p>This pattern uses AMP-HTML. Ideal for static sites.</p>
  </article>
